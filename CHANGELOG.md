## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-25

### Major Enhancement - Dynamic Source Loading with Advanced Fuzzy Matching

### Added
- **🌍 Dynamic Source Discovery** - Automatically fetches latest available regions from Geofabrik JSON API
- **📡 Real-time Source Updates** - No more hardcoded region lists, always up-to-date with Geofabrik offerings
- **🧠 Geographic Intelligence** - Knows `belgium` belongs to `europe`, suggests `europe/belgium` not `antarctica/belgium`
- **🎯 Standalone Country Recognition** - `luxembourg` → `europe/luxembourg`, `monaco` → `europe/monaco`
- **⚡ Smart Caching** - Uses `OnceLock` to cache API results, avoiding repeated calls
- **🛡️ Graceful Fallback** - Works offline with comprehensive fallback region list when API unavailable
- **🔄 HTTP Timeout Protection** - 5-second timeout for source discovery API calls

### Enhanced
- **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm**: Now works with dynamic source lists from Geofabrik
- **Error Messages**: More accurate suggestions based on real-time available regions
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Improved continent/country relationship detection
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with Geofabrik's index-v1.json endpoint

### Technical Details
- **Source Discovery**: Fetches from `https://download.geofabrik.de/index-v1.json`
- **Caching Strategy**: `std::sync::OnceLock` for thread-safe, lazy initialization
- **Fallback Logic**: Comprehensive hardcoded list when network unavailable
- **Geographic Logic**: Prioritizes correct continent/country combinations
- **Dependencies**: Added `serde_json` for JSON parsing

### Examples
```bash
# Before: Generic "not found" errors
butterfly-dl luxembourg
# Error: HttpError("Failed to get file info: 404 Not Found")

# After: Intelligent suggestions with dynamic sources
butterfly-dl luxembourg  
# Error: Source 'luxembourg' not found. Did you mean 'europe/luxembourg'?
```

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-25

### Major Enhancement - HTTP-Only Architecture with Intelligent Error Messages

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Removed S3 support and AWS dependencies - now HTTP-only for better security and simplicity
- All sources (planet, continents, countries) now use HTTP endpoints

### Added
- **🧠 Intelligent Error Messages** with fuzzy matching using Levenshtein distance algorithm
- **🔍 Smart Typo Detection** for common misspellings (e.g., "antartica" → "antarctica", "plant" → "planet")
- **🌍 Geographic Accuracy** - knows Belgium is in Europe, not Antarctica
- **📋 Comprehensive Integration Tests** for all download types with timeout handling
- **🚀 HTTP Timeouts** - connection (10s) and request (30s) timeouts to prevent hanging

### Changed
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed all S3 code, dependencies, and feature flags
- **Error Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages instead of raw HTTP errors
- **Documentation**: Updated all references from S3 to HTTP throughout README and CLI help

### Improved
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions in source names
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Different suggestions for unknown vs misspelled sources
- **Test Coverage**: Added integration tests for Antarctica (valid), invalid sources, and various countries

### Removed
- **AWS Dependencies**: `aws-config`, `aws-sdk-s3` removed from Cargo.toml
- **S3 Feature Flag**: Simplified to HTTP-only with optional `c-bindings` feature
- **S3 Code**: Removed all S3-related source variants, methods, and error types

### Technical Details
- **Planet Source**: Now uses `https://planet.openstreetmap.org/pbf/planet-latest.osm.pbf`
- **Continental/Country Sources**: All use `https://download.geofabrik.de/` endpoints
- **Error Algorithm**: Levenshtein distance with 33% character difference threshold
- **Integration Tests**: 7 tests including timeout scenarios and geographic validation

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-25

### Major Refactoring - Library + CLI Architecture

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Complete refactor from monolithic CLI to library + CLI architecture
- New public API for programmatic usage
- C FFI bindings for cross-language integration

### Added
- **🦀 Rust Library API** with `get()`, `get_stream()`, `get_with_progress()`, `get_with_options()`
- **📚 Static & Dynamic Libraries** for both Rust (`rlib`) and C-compatible (`a`, `so`, `dylib`, `dll`)
- **🔗 C FFI Bindings** with thread-safe progress callbacks and comprehensive C header
- **⚡ Smart Connection Strategy** - Single connection for files ≤1MB, scaled connections for larger files
- **🔧 pkg-config Support** for system-wide library installation
- **📊 Comprehensive Benchmarking** against curl and aria2 with MD5 validation
- **🏗️ Makefile Build System** with `make all`, `make c-lib`, `make install` targets
- **📝 Centralized Version Management** - Single `VERSION` file drives all components

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smart connection scaling** based on file size (1-16 connections)
- **Direct I/O support** for large files (>1GB) on Unix systems
- **Memory efficiency** - <1GB RAM usage regardless of file size
- **HTTP User-Agent versioning** for proper server identification

### Library Features
- **Progress callbacks** with `Arc<dyn Fn(u64, u64)>` for thread-safe progress tracking
- **Streaming API** for pipeline integration
- **Feature flags** for optional S3 support (`default = ["s3"]`)
- **Cross-platform support** - Windows, macOS, Linux

### Benchmarking & Testing
- **Multi-tool benchmarking** comparing butterfly-dl vs curl vs aria2
- **Automatic tool detection** - only tests available tools
- **Fair comparison** - matching connection strategies across tools
- **MD5 checksum validation** for file integrity verification
- **Performance metrics** - duration, speed, success/failure tracking

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive documentation** with usage examples for Rust and C
- **Build-time version management** - change `VERSION` file, rebuild gets new version everywhere
- **Example code** for both library and C FFI usage
- **Automated cleanup** in benchmark scripts

### Infrastructure
- **Build script integration** reads `VERSION` file and sets environment variables
- **Dependency tracking** - VERSION file changes trigger rebuilds
- **pkg-config template** for proper system integration

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-24

### Added
- **Geofabrik PBF Downloader Component** - Initial working implementation
- **Multi-connection parallel downloads** with 8 connections and 100MB chunks for optimal performance
- **File freshness checking** - Skip downloads if files are newer than `RENEW_PBF_PERIOD` (default: 7 days)
- **Complete CLI interface** with country, continent, and batch download support
- **List command** with filtering (countries/continents/all)
- **Dry-run mode** for previewing downloads without downloading
- **FROM scratch production Docker image** (13.4MB) for minimal attack surface
- **Development Docker image** with full Alpine + Rust toolchain for debugging
- **Convention over configuration** approach with hardcoded optimal defaults
- **Comprehensive test coverage** (16 tests) including integration tests
- **Makefile with production/development workflows**

### Performance
- **8 parallel connections** hardcoded for maximum speed
- **100MB chunks** optimized for large file downloads
- **Automatic range request detection** with fallback to single connection
- **Progress tracking** with real-time connection count display
- **Speed improvements**: Up to 15-40 MB/s vs 2-5 MB/s single connection

### Infrastructure

- **XP pair programming** workflow with human + AI collaboration
- **Comprehensive documentation** with clear usage examples
- **MIT license** and proper project metadata

### Notes
- This is the first component of the larger **butterfly** project
