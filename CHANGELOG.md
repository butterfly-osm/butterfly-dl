## butterfly-dl Evolution (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

*For detailed version history, see [butterfly-dl CHANGELOG](./tools/butterfly-dl/CHANGELOG.md)*

### Key Milestones

#### 🚀 **Performance Era** (1.4.x)
- Hurricane-fast downloads: **79% faster** than aria2, **3x faster** than curl
- Memory efficiency: **<1GB RAM** for any file size (including 81GB planet)
- Network resilience with intelligent retry and resume
- Beautiful progress displays with tqdm-style formatting

#### 🧠 **Intelligence Era** (1.2.x - 1.3.x)  
- Geographic-aware fuzzy matching: knows Belgium is in Europe, not Antarctica
- Dynamic source discovery from Geofabrik API
- Semantic error correction: "austrailia" → "australia-oceania" (not "austria")
- Real-time source updates, no hardcoded lists

#### 🏗️ **Architecture Era** (1.0.x - 1.1.x)
- Library + CLI architecture with C FFI bindings
- HTTP-only design for security and simplicity
- Smart connection scaling based on file size
- Comprehensive benchmarking against industry standards

#### 🛠️ **Foundation Era** (0.1.x)
- Multi-connection parallel downloads
- Docker-first development
- Convention over configuration approach
- Production-ready Geofabrik downloader

### Performance Achievements

| Metric | Achievement | Comparison |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Speed** | 14.07 MB/s | 79% faster than aria2 |
| **Memory** | <1GB fixed | 4-16x less than alternatives |
| **Reliability** | Smart resume | Network resilience with retry |
| **Intelligence** | Geographic fuzzy matching | Semantic understanding |

## Upcoming Tools

### 🔄 **Development Roadmap**

#### **Phase 2: Geometric Operations** 
- **butterfly-shrink**: Polygon-based extraction with GEOS integration
- Target: **10x faster** than osmium extract
- Memory limit: **<2GB** for planet-scale operations

#### **Phase 3: Data Transformation**
- **butterfly-extract**: Advanced filtering and transformation engine  
- Target: **5-10x faster** than osmosis
- Memory limit: **<1GB** for streaming operations

#### **Phase 4: High-Performance Serving**
- **butterfly-serve**: HTTP tile server with intelligent caching
