# Network resilience in action
# ⚠️ Network error (attempt 1): operation timed out. Retrying in 1000ms...
# ⚠️ Stream interrupted at 300MB, resuming...

# File overwrite protection
butterfly-dl europe/belgium
# ⚠️ File already exists: belgium-latest.osm.pbf
# Overwrite? [y/N]: n
# ❌ Download cancelled

## [1.3.0] - 2025-06-25

### Major Enhancement - Semantic Fuzzy Matching with Advanced Error Intelligence

### Added
- **🎯 Semantic Fuzzy Matching** - Hybrid algorithm combining character distance with semantic intent
- **🧠 Contextual Scoring** - Prefix similarity bonuses for compound words like "australia-oceania"
- **📏 Length-aware Matching** - Prioritizes semantically meaningful longer matches over short character artifacts
- **🔤 Substring Intelligence** - Matches against word parts in compound sources (e.g., "austrailia" matches "australia" in "australia-oceania")
- **🚫 Anti-bias Logic** - Penalizes very short matches when input is long to prevent incorrect suggestions
- **⚖️ Adaptive Thresholds** - Dynamic scoring that balances precision vs recall for different input types

### Enhanced
- **Critical Fix**: `austrailia` now correctly suggests `australia-oceania` instead of `europe/austria`
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Maintains continent-first matching while adding semantic intelligence
- **Algorithm Robustness**: Handles edge cases like `totally-invalid-place` (returns None) and `monac` → `europe/monaco`
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient scoring with configurable thresholds (0.65 minimum similarity)

### Technical Details
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines Jaro-Winkler (70%) + Normalized Levenshtein (30%) + semantic bonuses
- **Semantic Bonuses**: Prefix matching (20%), substring matching (12%), length similarity (10%)
- **Anti-patterns**: Reduces scores for inappropriate matches (short candidates for long inputs)
- **Library Integration**: Enhanced error messages available to all library consumers, not just CLI
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests ensuring semantic accuracy while maintaining existing functionality

### Examples
```bash
# Before: Incorrect semantic matching
butterfly-dl austrailia
# Error: Source 'austrailia' not found. Did you mean 'europe/austria'?

# After: Semantic intelligence
butterfly-dl austrailia  
# Error: Source 'austrailia' not found. Did you mean 'australia-oceania'?

# Maintains existing accuracy
butterfly-dl plant → "planet"
butterfly-dl monac → "europe/monaco"
butterfly-dl antartica → "antarctica"
```

- **📡 Real-time Source Updates** - No more hardcoded region lists, always up-to-date with Geofabrik offerings
- **🧠 Geographic Intelligence** - Knows `belgium` belongs to `europe`, suggests `europe/belgium` not `antarctica/belgium`
- **🎯 Standalone Country Recognition** - `luxembourg` → `europe/luxembourg`, `monaco` → `europe/monaco`
- **⚡ Smart Caching** - Uses `OnceLock` to cache API results, avoiding repeated calls
- **🛡️ Graceful Fallback** - Works offline with comprehensive fallback region list when API unavailable
- **🔄 HTTP Timeout Protection** - 5-second timeout for source discovery API calls

### Enhanced

- **Caching Strategy**: `std::sync::OnceLock` for thread-safe, lazy initialization
- **Fallback Logic**: Comprehensive hardcoded list when network unavailable
- **Geographic Logic**: Prioritizes correct continent/country combinations
- **Dependencies**: Added `serde_json` for JSON parsing

### Examples
```bash
# Before: Generic "not found" errors
butterfly-dl luxembourg
# Error: HttpError("Failed to get file info: 404 Not Found")

# After: Intelligent suggestions with dynamic sources
butterfly-dl luxembourg  
# Error: Source 'luxembourg' not found. Did you mean 'europe/luxembourg'?
```
